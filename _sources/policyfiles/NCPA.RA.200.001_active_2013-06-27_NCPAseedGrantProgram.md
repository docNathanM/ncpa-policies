## Purpose

The NCPA Seed Grant program is established with the purpose to fund projects or acquisitions that will enhance the competitiveness of NCPA for future externally funded proposals. 

## Introduction and Motivation

The NCPA will annually set aside funds to support a series of small seed grants with the goal to enhance the competitiveness of NCPA for future externally funded proposals. It is anticipated that each proposal will have a total budget between \$20,000-\$50,000 and have a performance period of 6-12 months. A key component of the proposal will be a plan for how the results will be leveraged to enhance external funding. Funding of the Seed Grants will be decided on a year-by-year basis as NCPA resources allow.

## Structure of Proposal

The total length of the proposal shall not exceed 2 pages (excluding budget and references). The precise structure is flexible, but the following components should be addressed:

- Introduction to the scientific question(s) to be studied
- Objectives, a research plan and a time schedule for the performance.
- A narrative describing how these new results or capabilities will be used in future proposals. This should include a list of potential sponsors, why they would be interested, and past efforts in acquiring funding in this area.
- A budget including:
  - salary and fringe for all personnel to be involved – if budget allows, this could include time to develop a full external proposal
  - equipment and supplies required
  - publication fees (if applicable)
  - appropriate travel / conference fees for the PI (if applicable)
- A brief justification for equipment and travel is required.
- F&A is NOT required since this is an internal grant.
- Requests of funds to be used solely for the purpose of purchasing equipment are not encouraged, however new equipment to support “proof of principle” experiments would be appropriate.

## Evaluation of Proposals and Timing

A subcommittee consisting of members of the Executive Committee and Advisory Board will be formed by the Director to evaluate proposals. Proposals will be considered on a biannual basis with due dates of May 1 and November 1. Proposal documents should be emailed to Debra Perrier (<dperrier@olemiss.edu>). The subcommittee will make a recommendation to the Director about whether each proposal would be a good use of NCPA resources and, if necessary, rank proposals. They may also make recommendations on the proposed SOW and Budget. The Director will make the decision whether to fund each proposal and will be prepared to defend the decision to the committee. Decisions will be made known to all PIs within 4 weeks of submission.

## Evaluation of Funded Projects

Within one month of completion of a funded project, the PI will present the results to the Executive Committee and have a discussion about the pursuit of external funding. If appropriate, the PI may also be asked to present the results during an NCPA seminar.
