<!-- ## Things That Need Work Next

- [ ] **NCPA.ED.100.001 needs immediate revision based on current pay structure and "temp employment" policies within HR.**
- [ ] Create NCPA.GV.300.002  *Affiliate Status Definition and Expectations*
  - My idea is that ... "affiliation" does not assume allocation of physical space within the building nor does it expect a share of indirect costs generated except in the case of funding support for NCPA scientist or staff through a re-grant process.
- [ ] Note in NCPA.GV.300.001 that "Joint Appointment" implies affiliate status but affiliate status does not imply a joint appointment.
- [ ] Currently we lack any written policy on
  - space allocation
  - executive committee membership/rotation
  - advisory board membership/rotation/duties -->
