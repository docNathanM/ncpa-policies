# Building Access Security Policy

**file**: *NCPA.SC.100.001_active_2018-08-30_buildingAccessProtocols*

**status**: active

## University Policy Department (UPD) and Emergencies

**For emergencies dial 4-911** from any campus phone or call 915-7234.

- UPD will not be entering the building due to propped door alarms or forced entry alarms.  
- This means that NCPA employees must be diligent in securing our building. 
- If you see anyone in the building that you do not recognize, say "Hello" and get to know them if you feel safe in doing so. Call UPD if you feel unsafe or have any concern.

## Building Access Policies 

1. Building access to the exterior at **ALL TIMES**:

    1.  Access is restricted to only three doors **at all times** (EXCEPT in cases of EMERGENCY): FRONT main entrance, BACK main entrance, and East LOADING DOCK (not Machine Shop loading dock). See {numref}`buildingAccess` below for illustration.

    2.  Machinists will have use of the Machine Shop doors and hallway door near the Machine Shop.

    3.  Exceptions for access through other doors might be granted under certain circumstances for a limited time. Send an email request to LaTonya and/or Debra.

    4.  Nerd node doors must be locked at all times. After use, they must be relocked.

    5.  No propped doors.

2.  **AFTERHOURS** access to building:

    1.  Afterhours are considered to be M-F 6:00 PM – 7:30 AM, all day Sat-Sun, and holidays.
