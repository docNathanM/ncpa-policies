**status**: active

**Purpose**

The purpose of this document is to establish the governance structure of the NCPA, including regular administration and the decision-making process. Primary governance shall be the responsibility of a Director. An Executive Committee will be responsible for high impact decisions, such as restructuring and expansion, and use of significant resources. An Associate Director will be a permanent member of the Executive Committee and perform the Directorâ€™s duties when the Director is unavailable.

**Duties of the Director**

> 1\. Represent and promote the NCPA and its principal investigators to internal and external stakeholders.
>
> 2\. Oversee the day-to-day operations of the center, in conjunction with a Research Administrative Coordinator.
>
> 3\. Chair the Executive Committee and facilitate a collegial and productive environment within the center.
>
> 4\. The Director shall make decisions on the use of all funds, less than \$50k, associated with the NCPA operational accounts and the minor allocations of space within the NCPA. Major changes in allocation of space will be addressed by the EC. This does not include research (30) accounts or individual PI overhead accounts.

**Qualifications of the Director:**

> 1\. *Proven* track record of interdisciplinary collaboration
>
> 2\. *Demonstrated* capability to articulate technical/scientific content to any audience
>
> 3\. *Documented* standing within the academic/scientific community
>
> 4\. *Capable* of obtaining U.S. security clearance

**Associate Director**

The Associate Director is a partial time position responsible for assisting the director in the above-named duties and assembling the annual report for the evaluation of the Director. The Associate Director is empowered to represent the Director when the Director is unavailable.

**Executive Committee**

The Executive Committee (EC) will meet at least once per month to provide an opportunity to discuss issues involving the NCPA as a whole, make decisions on restructuring and expansions, approve use of building resources, and provide guidance to the Director. The total number of members is 5-7 (not including the Director, who will Chair the EC).

**1. Structure**

The EC will consist of 3-4 NCPA scientists who are serving as principal investigators and 2-3 tenured or tenure track faculty with active research programs. The NCPA group leaders or their delegates will typically serve as EC members. This distribution may periodically need to be adjusted to reflect the current researcher profile of the NCPA. The Director shall serve as Chair of the EC and have a full vote. The Associate Director will serve as a permanent member with a full vote.

**2. Authority**

> a\. All expenditures of \$50k or larger must be approved by the EC through a majority vote.
>
> b\. Major changes in allocations of space within the NCPA.
>
> c\. This policy can be changed by 2/3 majority vote of the EC.
>
> d\. Information should be provided to the EC at least 2 days before the meeting and vote. Under special circumstances, votes can be shared by email or teleconference.

**3. Rotation**

Membership rotation is tied to the NCPA organizational chart. Designated Group Leaders (or their delegates) will typically be members of the EC. This provides enough flexibility to accommodate new high-level researchers.

**4. Evaluation of the Director**

The Director shall provide a brief annual report to the EC on his/her activities with respect to listed duties, use of building resources, and plans or concerns for the future. The EC will prepare an annual evaluation of the Director to be submitted to the Director for comment and the report and comments are to be forwarded to the VC of Research and Sponsored Programs.
