**SUBJECT: NCPA GUIDELINES REGARDING STUDENT EMPLOYMENT**

It has recently come to my attention that there are issues regarding differences in student pay.

Below are guidelines that should be followed.

1)  Graduate students should be paid based on the following:

    1.  New Students will receive from \$1,380 to \$1,725/month depending on qualifications which include undergraduate teaching experience, GPA and GRE scores.

    2.  Students with MA/MS will receive up to \$1,917/month

    3.  Students with MA/MS and passed comps will receive up to \$2,107/month

    4.  Students with MA/MS, passed comps, & successfully defended prospectus should receive up to \$2,395/month

    5.  Tuition waiver for current in-state amount should be awarded to all graduate students if possible (depends on funding).

2)  Undergraduate students should be paid based on the following:

    1.  High School Students (Summer Program) \$5.50

    2.  Freshmen \$6.00

    3.  Sophomores \$6.50

    4.  Juniors \$7.00

    5.  Seniors \$7.50

3)  Students who graduate in the Spring Semester and who are employed by NCPA during that time may continue to work through the summer as a student by completing student employment paperwork. This is allowed because the University cannot determine whether or not the student will take classes in the fall. This IS NOT the case for students who graduate in the Fall Semester. If a student is not registered for the Spring Semester after completion of their degree in the fall, they MAY NOT work as students. If you decide that you need the student to continue working, a form 50 must be completed and you must hire the student as a temporary or permanent employee based on your needs.

4)  Students should not be allowed to begin work until all paperwork is completed through Human Resources. Please remember that foreign students MUST have the correct paperwork in place to work and they *cannot* be paid otherwise.

Note that the above pay scales are guidelines. If you need to go outside these guidelines (high or low), please discuss with me.
