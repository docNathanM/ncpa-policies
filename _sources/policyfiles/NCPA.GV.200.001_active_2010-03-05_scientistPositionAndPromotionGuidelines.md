**file**: *NCPA.GV.200.001_active_2010-03-05_scientistPositionAndPromotionGuidelines*

**status**: active

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to outline procedures and policies for appointment and promotions of scientists. The procedures and policies described here are meant to be internal guidelines within NCP A.

## Titles

There are six titles that are appropriate:

1. Principal Scientist
2. Senior Scientist II
3. Senior Scientist
4. Scientist II
5. Scientist I
6. Associate Scientist

## Appointment and Promotion

The initial appointment of Scientists will be initiated by the Director, NCPA, and coordinated with other Scientists within the Center. A joint appointment as Research Professor is common but such appointments must follow the guidelines of the academic department involved.

An individual who fulfills the necessary requirements for time-in-service is eligible to be considered for promotion in the fall of the year prior to promotion. Consideration will be initiated by a request from the individual requesting consideration for promotion. If the Director finds that the individual meets minimum requirements, the individual will be invited to submit materials to support a request for promotion. The promotion process follows the applicable University policies and procedures as described in [ACA.FG.400.006](https://policies.olemiss.edu/ShowDetails.jsp?istatPara=1&policyObjidPara=12606017).
