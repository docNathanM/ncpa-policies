# NCPA Policy and Operations Manual

The *NCPA Policy and Operations Manual* contains the definitions, policies, rules, and procedures that serve to establish and implement the functions of the Jamie L. Whitten National Center for Physical Acoustics. The aim of this manual is to ensure transparency, clarity, accessibility, and adherence to the governing ideals that are foundational to the vision and mission of the NCPA.

## Vision + Purpose
 
The National Center for Physical Acoustics (NCPA) is the national source of expertise in acoustics and related physical sciences, driving innovation and progress across the field. The mission of the NCPA is to:
- **INNOVATE** through vigorous basic and applied research programs in acoustics to ensure a viable national source of expertise.
- **EDUCATE** graduate and undergraduate students with knowledge and experience on the frontiers of acoustics.
- **PRODUCE** future researchers, teachers, practitioners and leaders in acoustics.
- **ENHANCE** the overall educational and research mission of the University of Mississippi.
- **PROMOTE** economic growth through partnerships with industry and government.

Physical acoustics, a specialized branch within the domains of physics and acoustics, studies how acoustic waves interact with different materials—solids, liquids and gasses—on both macroscopic and microscopic scales. This field encompasses the investigation of mechanical vibrations, wave propagation, and the complex interactions of sound with other phenomena, including fluids, thermal waves, light, electrons, and magnetic excitations.

NCPA leads in the application and theoretical understanding of physical acoustics, driving innovation and solving real-world problems across a spectrum of fields of study

## NCPA Distinctives
 
### A Legacy of Innovation
Founded by Congress in 1987, NCPA is the nation’s first and only center for physical acoustics. With a long history of advancing research, innovation, and application, our work has had an undeniable influence on a diverse range of fields—from military and defense and aerospace to environmental conservation and medical device development to catfish farming and pest control. We aim to continuously lead the way in exploring and applying physical acoustics to real-world demands and challenges.

### A Distinct Approach
At NCPA, we place equal emphasis on the reasons behind a problem or need as we do on the outcomes. Rather than depending on trial and error, we delve deep into understanding the fundamental causes of problems. This commitment to the "why" allows us to uncover extensive knowledge and craft superior solutions that work.

### Fostering a Culture of Collaboration
Our team at NCPA brings together an interdisciplinary expertise, encompassing researchers, engineers and academics, each committed to their specialized field while equally dedicated to collaboration across the center. By pooling our diverse skills, we are able to tackle challenges and drive meaningful innovations. This organization is not just about individual achievements but about collectively pushing the boundaries of the field towards groundbreaking discoveries and practical applications.

### Creating the Next Generation of Researchers and Industry Leaders
NCPA is responsible for educating, training, and inspiring generations of acoustics researchers, developers, and gamechangers. Our alumni have gone on to lead and excel at renowned institutions, organizations, and universities worldwide, including NASA, Ford Motor Company, Apple, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Amazon, Adobe, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and SpaceX.

### Facilities For Innovation 
Located on the campus of the University of Mississippi, in Oxford, Miss., NCPA operates from an expansive 85,000-square-foot facility designed to foster innovation. Our building features an anechoic chamber, a Mach 5 wind tunnel, and an anechoic hot-jet laboratory. low-speed wind tunnels for aerodynamic studies. Additional facilities include low-speed wind tunnels, an underwater acoustics tank, Faraday lab spaces, 3-D printing for prototype development, and a high-tech machine shop equipped with state-of-the-art CAD services for precision in-house design.

### Internationally Respected Expertise
Our researchers and engineers are globally recognized for their deep expertise and extensive experience. They actively contribute to the acoustics community by presenting research at conferences worldwide, publishing in journals, and serving on boards and committees across various sectors.
