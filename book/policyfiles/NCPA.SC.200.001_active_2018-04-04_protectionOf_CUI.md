## Protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)

The University of Mississippi is required to be in full compliance with [DFAR 252.204-7012](https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/252.204-7012-safeguarding-covered-defense-information-and-cyber-incident-reporting.) and [NIST Standard 800-171](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/800-171r3/NIST.SP.800-171r3.html) not later than 31 December 2017. This National Center for Physical Acoustics policy is implemented to achieve compliance and is mandatory for all employees who generate, use, or report on Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and media on which CUI is stored, processed, or disseminated. CUI includes technical information with military or space application that is subject to controls on the access, use, reproduction, modification, performance, display, release, disclosure, or dissemination.

### Electronic Security

31. All computers and servers containing CUI shall be registered with UM at the Campus Server Registry (<https://itsecurity.olemiss.edu/registry>).

32. Obtain a baseline snapshot of CUI server’s or computer’s configuration. Any deviations from the baseline configuration should be manually recorded, reviewed, and approved by authorized users. In addition, full configuration snapshot comparison shall be done every 6 months and the results shall be retained for 3 years.

33. All CUI computers shall have an anti-virus software that is regularly updated.

34. Software will be set to allow for automatic updates. Recommended critical and important updates shall be made as soon as possible.

35. Notify the PI (or their designated representative) writing if a well-known application or software is to be installed. Well known applications and software are applications and software from reputable vendors whose products are widely used and are available through the University IT Department.

36. If a lesser known software is to be installed, a permission must be formally requested and granted in writing by the PI (or their designated representative).

37. Each authorized user of a CUI computer shall review all programs and applications installed on the computer and remove anything not essential to the computer’s functions (for example games and other software that come pre-installed on computers). This shall be done when a new computer is being configured or an existing one is being marked as CUI, as well as on yearly basis. The review shall be documented and retained for 3 years or the lifetime of the computer, whichever is longer.

38. Each authorized user of a CUI computer shall review all functions enabled on the computer and disable those not deemed essential to the computer’s function (for example Bluetooth or optical drive). This shall be done when a new computer is being configured or an existing one is being marked as CUI, as well as on yearly basis. The review shall be documented and retained for 3 years or the lifetime of the computer, whichever is longer.

39. If a control classification of information on a secure shared drive changes, the project group’s PI shall ensure that all people with authorized access to the drive have the right authorization. If the information is not required to be there anymore, it will be deleted/sanitized.

40. Each CUI computer and server shall be setup to automatically record the following events: log-in, log-out, failed logins, and escalation of privilege. These logs shall be reviewed weekly by the person to whom the computer is assigned and shall be retained for at least 1 year. Any discrepancy in weekly audits by individual users shall be treated as a threat and reported to the helpdesk for further analysis.

41. Any warning messages that appear on your computer screen should not be ignored and the helpdesk should be contacted immediately, prior to taking any other actions.

42. Two-factor authentication shall be enforced and utilized to access UM email, privileged accounts on the computers (Administrator) and servers hosting CUI project data.

43. CUI transmitted by e-mail shall be encrypted. Passwords for access to encrypted CUI shall be transmitted in a separate e-mail that does not contain the word “password” and that e-mail shall be encrypted or passwords shall be transmitted by telephone or fax.

44. To ensure that authenticity of the logon screen during each login action on a computer, each CUI computer will be configured to require the user pressing CTRL+ALT+DELETE before being able to enter their log on credentials. The sequence CTRL+ALT+DELETE applies to Windows operating systems.

45. Only industry approved (and preferably UM IT recommended) password manager programs shall be used for password management/storage.

46. Wireless access to laptop computers and other devices containing CUI shall be authorized for each session and terminated upon conclusion.

47. Data shall be backed up at least weekly for on-site backup and at least yearly for off-site backup. Off-site backup shall be in a designated area of Barr Hall.
