# Joint Appointment Guidelines

**file**: *NCPA.GV.300.001_active_2013-12-31_jointAppointmentGuidelines*

**status**: active

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to describe the criteria by which a faculty member may establish and maintain a joint appointment (JA) between the NCPA and another unit at the University of Mississippi (UM). These JAs fall into two categories: 1) the faculty member has a primary appointment in an academic unit and would like to establish a formal relationship with the NCPA, or 2) the faculty member has a primary appointment at the NCPA and would like to establish a formal relationship with an academic unit. These guidelines will serve as the basis for a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between NCPA and the other unit, specific to each case.

## Case 1: Primary in Another Unit, Secondary in NCPA

### Salary Support

NCPA is a research unit, dependent entirely upon external funding. NCPA will not contribute to the salary of the faculty member or research/startup funding unless special circumstances are demonstrated and negotiated.

### Office and Lab Space

Every reasonable effort will be made to provide office and lab space appropriate to the research needs of the applicant. These needs must be outlined and justified (including technical aspects of the space) in a written document submitted to the Director of the NCPA. If appropriate space is not available at the NCPA, the Director will work with the Department Chair of the primary unit to find a solution.

### F\&A (Indirect Costs) Recoveries

For any funded research occurring within the NCPA and/or utilizing NCPA resources, the primary unit and NCPA will evenly split the F\&A Recoveries. For projects only partially utilizing NCPA resources, an appropriate split will be negotiated between the NCPA Director and Department Chair and/or Dean.

### Level of Effort

NCPA is a research organization, so no teaching load will be required by NCPA. Minimal service to NCPA will be required in the form of serving on the Executive Committee, periodically being available during VIP tours of the NCPA, participation in committees with a targeted purpose, etc.

### Promotion and Tenure

The faculty member will be eligible for promotion within the NCPA rank structure and must follow the procedures outlined in the NCPA Promotion Policy (see [[NCPA.GV.200.001]] and [[NCPA.GV.200.002]]). This will be independent of the academic tenure and promotion process. NCPA leadership will not be involved in tenure decisions unless requested by UM administration.

### Annual Evaluations

Annual evaluations shall be the responsibility of the administration in the primary academic unit.

## Case 2: Primary at NCPA, Secondary in Another Unit

### Salary Support

NCPA researchers will continue to support their salary through external funding at a level appropriate to their effort toward those projects. If a teaching load or service is required, the academic unit will be expected to contribute to the researcherâ€™s salary commensurate with the level of effort. In general, the teaching load should not exceed 2 courses per year.

### Office and Lab Space

The research faculty will be allowed to keep current office and lab space at NCPA as long they are engaged in active funded research.

### F\&A Recoveries

The use of NCPA resources in this scenario is highly variable, thus the split of F\&A will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis but will in general depend on the percentage of NCPA resources utilized for a given project. Thus, the scenario may even vary from project-to-project for the same PI.

### Level of Effort

The NCPA researcher will be expected to maintain an active externally funded research program located at the NCPA. They will also be expected to contribute some service to the NCPA in the form of serving on the Executive Committee, periodically be available during VIP tours of the NCPA, participation in committees with a targeted purpose, etc.

### Tenure and Promotion

NCPA is not a tenure granting organization. The faculty member will still be eligible for promotion within the NCPA rank structure and must follow the procedures outlined in the NCPA Promotion Policy (see [[NCPA.GV.200.001]] and [[NCPA.GV.200.002]]).

### Annual Evaluations

Annual evaluations shall be the responsibility of the NCPA administration.

### Ending a Joint Appointment

If the originally agreed upon expectations for a JA are not being met, the NCPA leadership has the right to dissolve the JA. Prior to this decision, the NCPA Director will work with the joint appointee, Department Chair, and/or Dean to discuss the problems and seek a remedy.

### Overhead Accounts for Faculty/Staff Departing UM

Control of remaining overhead accounts will go to the unit in which the faculty or researcher has their primary appointment.

### Membership in the NCPA Community

JAs will be invited to all NCPA-wide social events, meetings, seminars, retreats, etc.

### Required Signatures

Establishing a joint appointment will require the following approvals:

1.  Director, NCPA
2.  Dept. Chair / Director of Partner UM Unit
3.  Dean of Partner Unit
4.  Vice Chancellor of Research and Sponsored Programs
5.  Provost
