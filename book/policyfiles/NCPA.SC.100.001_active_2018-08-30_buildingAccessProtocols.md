# Building Access Security Policy

**file**: *NCPA.SC.100.001_active_2018-08-30_buildingAccessProtocols*

**status**: active

## University Policy Department (UPD) and Emergencies

**For emergencies dial 4-911** from any campus phone or call 915-7234.

- UPD will not be entering the building due to propped door alarms or forced entry alarms.  
- This means that NCPA employees must be diligent in securing our building. 
- If you see anyone in the building that you do not recognize, say "Hello" and get to know them if you feel safe in doing so. Call UPD if you feel unsafe or have any concern.

## Building Access Policies 

1. Building access to the exterior at **ALL TIMES**:

    1.  Access is restricted to only three doors **at all times** (EXCEPT in cases of EMERGENCY): FRONT main entrance, BACK main entrance, and East LOADING DOCK (not Machine Shop loading dock). See {numref}`buildingAccess` below for illustration.

    2.  Machinists will have use of the Machine Shop doors and hallway door near the Machine Shop.

    3.  Exceptions for access through other doors might be granted under certain circumstances for a limited time. Send an email request to LaTonya and/or Debra.

    4.  Nerd node doors must be locked at all times. After use, they must be relocked.

    5.  No propped doors.

2.  **AFTERHOURS** access to building:

    1.  Afterhours are considered to be M-F 6:00 PM – 7:30 AM, all day Sat-Sun, and holidays.

    2.  Second offense - Automatic loss of afterhours privileges for 30 days

    3.  Third offense - Permanent loss of afterhours privileges

## In the Event of a Fire Alarm

In the event of a fire alarm, everyone should proceed to the nearest exit in a calm manner and waited outside until the fire department has cleared the building.

[Facilities Management operations website](https://facilitiesmanagement.olemiss.edu/mission-vision-values/facilities-operations/additional-services/) includes this direction for all building occupants:

All occupants are required to leave the building when a fire alarm sound. Occupants evacuating a building should not use elevators. Occupants should use the stairwells. No one should re-enter the building until authorized to do so by fire officials. Once out of the building, report the fire location by dialing 911 or by notifying University Police by dialing 662-915-7234 on a cell phone or by using a phone in another building. Malicious tampering with building fire alarms, fire protection systems or fire extinguishers is prohibited. Violators are subject to disciplinary action, monetary fine or both.
